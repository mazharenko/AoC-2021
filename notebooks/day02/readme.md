[Problem statement](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)

Actually, the input format might be a valid F# code.
```fsharp
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2
```
All we have to do is save the input as fsx file, define corresponding function and then load the input so that it will execute.
